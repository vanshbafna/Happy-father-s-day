                <h2> Father’s day is one occasion which comes
                 with an opportunity to make your Dad feel
                  special and make him realise his contribution
                   in the whole family set up. When a child is born,
                    right from the day, to him his father is his
                     superhero. The child learns to move and take
                      the first step with his Father. Children therefore,
                       look for ways to enchant their Fathers and shower
                        upon love with a heart full of Love.
                         Here we are going to educate the audience
                          on making powerfully done speeches on
                           father’s day and will be sharing a few of
                            them. </h2>
